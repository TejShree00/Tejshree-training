<h1>Specificity Rules</h1>
<p>
    <pre>

<strong>Equal specificity:</strong> the latest rule counts - If the same rule is written twice into the external style sheet, 
then the lower rule in the style sheet is closer to the element to be styled,and therefore will be applied:

A: h1<br>
B: #content h1<br>
C: div id="content" h1 style="color: #ffffff" 
<br>
The specificity of A is 1 (one element)<br>
The specificity of B is 101 (one ID reference and one element)<br>
The specificity of C is 1000 (inline styling)<br>

Since 1 is less than 101 is less than 1000, the third rule (C) has a greater level of specificity, and therefore will be applied.
