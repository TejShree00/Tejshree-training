            They look weird, they're weird to cut into, we can't figure out where they come from or how they grow, 
            and while we love them already cut up in prepared fruit salads or tropical drinks, 
            the thought of actually having to pick one of these spiky buggers up at the grocery store scares the bejesus out of us.<br><br>
