        <p>Chania is by far one of the best Greek islands to visit. It boasts an old harbour dating back to the 14th century and ringed by a promenade lined with cafes and seafood restaurants.

            As you stroll east of the harbour, you’ll pass by a small mosque, built by the Ottoman Turks after they invaded Chania in 1645. Today, it serves as an art gallery and right behind it, you’ll find grand Venetian arsenals that were built during the 1600s.
            
            To get the most out of your trip, I highly recommend you book a sunset cruise from Chania Old Harbour to enjoy a romantic sunset as you sail toward Lazaretta Island.
           <br><br> A 21-meter tall lighthouse dominates the entrance of the Chania town harbour. It was built by the Venetians in the 14th century and is one of the oldest lighthouses in the world. It underwent construction in 1830 and operated until 1933 as a port lamp, but it is no longer operational anymore.

            Visitors aren’t allowed in, but you can walk along the pier and take beautiful pictures with the lighthouse as your backdrop.
